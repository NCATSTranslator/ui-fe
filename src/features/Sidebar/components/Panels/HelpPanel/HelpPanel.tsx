Each relationship has clear evidence and sources that come from accumulated knowledge sources, supported by large data sets or scientific literature. One of the strengths of Translator is the integration of these knowledge sources to facilitate connecting concepts that could not previously be connected in a single place.",

For example, if A is related to B and B is related to C, Translator not only provides a visual representation of this concept, it also provides an interface to access the evidence available for each 'hop' in the concept chain."
